It's my first data science project. I tried to predict if patient have a diabetes or not, based on diagnostic measurements. With this dataset score is not amazing. I've got 0.71 accuracy on my chosen model but I foccused on tune recall parameter(I described it on notebook). Predicted label was unbalanced, so maybe beacuse of that fact it is hard to obtain better performance. Perhaps oversampling method would be helplfull here. Check out notebook to find source code, plots, model and conclusion.
